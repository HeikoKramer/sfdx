It is important to understand

Salesforce Help: [Data and File Storage Allocations](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.overview_storage.htm&type=5) <br>
Storage is based on the **Salesforce edition** + the **number of licenses** purchased. <br>
Storage is divided into two categories â€“ **file storage** and **data storage**. <br>
**File storage** includes
* files in attachments
* Files home
* Salesforce CRM Content
* Chatter files (including user photos)
* the Documents tab
* the custom File field on Knowledge articles
* Site.com assets

**Data storage** includes all standard and custom object **records**. <br>
The most Salesforce editions come with **10 GB of data storage** for their production environment. <br>
Exceptions are the **Developer (5MB)** and the **Personal (20MB)** editions. <br>
Additional license data storage allocation is not available for those two editions. <br>
The other editions get storage allocated per user license as following: <br>

**+ 20MB per License:**
* Contact Manager
* Group
* Professional
* Enterprise

**+ 120MB per License:**\*
* Performance
* Unlimited

\* *20 MB for Lightning Platform Starter user licenses* <br>
