## Data Modeling
### [Types of Salesforce Objects & Storage](https://youtu.be/Sw-iqjxdI7w?t=767)
It is important to understand 
* when you create a record, how much space it takes in the system
* what are the various ways of storing the data 
* what is the impact of this

#### [Data Storage](https://youtu.be/Sw-iqjxdI7w?t=835)
Salesforce Help: [Data and File Storage Allocations](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.overview_storage.htm&type=5) <br>
Storage is based on the **Salesforce edition** + the **number of licenses** purchased. <br>
Storage is divided into two categories – **file storage** and **data storage**. <br>
**File storage** includes
* files in attachments
* Files home
* Salesforce CRM Content
* Chatter files (including user photos)
* the Documents tab
* the custom File field on Knowledge articles
* Site.com assets

**Data storage** includes all standard and custom object **records**. <br>
The most Salesforce editions come with **10 GB of data storage** for their production environment. <br>
Exceptions are the **Developer (5MB)** and the **Personal (20MB)** editions. <br>
Additional license data storage allocation is not available for those two editions. <br>
The other editions get storage allocated per user license as following: <br>

**+ 20MB per License:**
* Contact Manager
* Group
* Professional
* Enterprise

<br>

**+ 120MB per License:**\*
* Performance
* Unlimited

\* *20 MB for Lightning Platform Starter user licenses* <br>

#### [Big Objects](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.bigobjects.meta/bigobjects/big_object.htm)
Description from developer.salesforce.com: <br>
*A big object stores and manages massive amounts of data on the Salesforce platform. <br>
You can archive data from other objects or bring massive datasets from outside systems into a big object to get a full view of your customers. <br>
Clients and external systems use a standard set of APIs to access big object data. <br>
A big object provides consistent performance, whether you have 1 million records, 100 million, or even 1 billion. <br>
This scale gives a big object its power and defines its features.*
<br>
Edition availability: <br>
* Enterprise
* Performance
* Unlimited
* Developer

Initial record capacity: **up to 1 million records** <br>
Additional record capacity and async SOQL query is available as an **add-on license**. <br>
<br>
**Types of Big Objects:** <br>
* **Standard Big Object**
  * defined by Salesforce
  * included in Salesforce products
    * *FieldHistoryArchive* is a standard big object
  * cannot be customized

<br>

* **Custom Big Object**
  * created to store information unique to your org
  * extend the platform functionality
